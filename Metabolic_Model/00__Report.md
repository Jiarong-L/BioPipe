## 1. Background

Menopausal transition is a natural aging process of ovarian functions, which could last for years. During this process, estrogen levels will be decreased due to ovarian aging and fluctuate due to the compensatory increase of FSH. As the loss of estrogen breaks the formal homeostasis, women in menopause may suffer physiological symptoms such as hot flashes (cardiovascular related), bone loss (calcium balance), and weight gain (lipid metabolism). 

[Cognitive declines are measurable during the menopausal period](https://www.swanstudy.org/fact-sheets/), which could be a mixed effect of social factors, the sufferings from physical symptoms, and the direct impact on the brain. It remains unclear whether it is associated with the higher risk of cognitive diseases (Alzheimer's) in aged women than in men, as mechanisms in menopausal periods seem to be different from aged periods: [higher estradiol levels in aged people (age>55) are associated with a higher risk of dementia](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.10521). 

[Hormone therapies (MHT)](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-requests-labeling-changes-related-safety-information-clarify-benefitrisk-considerations) are suggested to relieve and prevent the menopausal symptoms (not for aged persons), with careful considerations in minimal doses, durations, and risks of breast cancer or cardiovascular diseases. 

In this attempt, let's see the brain cells of the meopausal brain and simulate respond to the hormone levels, using:
